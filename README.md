# All-My-Projects
Collection of all the projects I made and will make. Welcome!


## User App Backend 
MongoAss stands for Mongo Assignment because that is how it started. 
This is the backend implementation for : 
- new user sign up
- existing user sign in 
- user credential validation 
- token verification using jwt
- zod validation for input headers 
- supports all CRUD operations (route for each operation)

It is a culmination project for 3-4 weeks of the 100xDevs - Cohort 2. This may not seem like much to seasoned people but it is nice to me since I didn't even know javascript 3 weeks back and thought node.js was a language! Heh! Kudos to Harkirat for a great and accommodating cohort!
